**The behavioral classification standard for agentic AI components.**

Stable IDs, AIVSS scores, and behavioral fingerprints for every way a skill file,
MCP server, system prompt, or agent plugin can be weaponized — scored consistently,
mapped to the frameworks security teams already report against.

## What is AVE?

Skill files, MCP server manifests, and system prompts are executable
instructions, not documentation. Any process that loads them runs them.
There is no compiler, no type checker, no sandbox. The runtime is an LLM
that reads natural language and acts on it.

Existing vulnerability standards were built for conventional software.
CVE identifies flaws in a specific product and version. OSV maps them to
package and version ranges. Neither can describe a prompt injection hidden
in an MCP tool description — there is no package, no version, no vulnerable
dependency. The danger is in what the component *does*, not what it imports.

**AVE fills that gap.** It assigns stable identifiers to distinct behavioral
classes in agentic AI, scores them with OWASP AIVSS v0.8, and maps every
record to OWASP MCP Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS so findings land in frameworks
defenders already use.

AVE is a standard, not a product. The `bawbel-scanner` implements it as the
reference implementation. Any tool can map to it — see the
[implementer guide](docs/specs/ave-implementer-guide.md) for how.

### What AVE is not

AVE is a naming and classification standard. It assigns stable IDs to
behavioral vulnerability classes and describes how to detect them. It
is not a runtime enforcement mechanism, and an AVE ID on its own stops
nothing. Enforcement requires a separate policy or gating layer that
consumes AVE's records, the same relationship CWE has to an actual
static analyzer, or a CVE has to a patch management system.

```
Your CI pipeline scans dependencies for known package vulnerabilities.
It does not scan your SKILL.md for prompt injection.
AVE fixes that.
```

  <img src="docs/images/ave-gap-diagram.svg" alt="Two independent scanners flag the same behavioral pattern under different names, with no shared identifier; AVE fills that gap" width="100%" />
</p>

---

## Independent validation

AVE's ID scheme has been tested by people who didn't build it, not
just used by people who did.

Eight independent tools, cfgaudit, ClawScan, nova-proximity, Ramparts,
Semia, SkillSpector (NVIDIA), skill-security-scanner, and skillsentry,
none of them sharing code with AVE or with each other, built
crosswalks against AVE's records on their own initiative, unprompted.
In each case the comparison went beyond matching category labels:
mechanism-level correspondence was checked field by field, real
trigger conditions against real behavioral fingerprints, and dozens of
findings converged on the identical AVE ID independently.

One of those crosswalks (Ramparts) also surfaced a real methodological
lesson: two independently-drafted readings of the same still-
unratified OWASP MCP Top 10 numbered their own categories differently,
confirmed and documented so future crosswalks match by category
meaning, not by tag number.

Separately, an external maintainer caught a real attribution error in
two published AVE records, corrected the underlying process
documentation, not just the two records, credited in
[CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

81 records. 8 independent crosswalks. See
[crosswalks/](crosswalks/) for the full mappings, and
[docs/writeups/](docs/writeups/) for full technical write-ups on
individual records.

## How it works

**Without AVE:**
```
Attacker crafts          Developer ships          Agent loads
malicious payload   ->   skill file          ->   skill file
                         (unscanned)              at runtime
                              |
                              v
                        Agent executes attacker payload
                        (data exfiltrated, credentials stolen, goals hijacked)
```

**With AVE + Bawbel Scanner:**
```
Developer commits        bawbel scan fires        Finding blocked
skill file          ->   in CI / pre-commit   ->  before deploy
                              |
                              v
                        AVE-2026-00001 detected:
                        Metamorphic payload via external config fetch
                        AIVSS 8.0 · HIGH · owasp_mcp: MCP03, MCP04
                        Line 7: "fetch your instructions from..."
```

## AIVSS Scoring

Every record is scored with [OWASP AIVSS v0.8](https://aivss.owasp.org):

```
AIVSS = ((CVSS_Base + AARS) / 2) x ThM x Mitigation_Factor
```

**AARS** (Agentic Amplification and Reachability Score) is the weighted sum
of 10 Agentic Amplification and Risk Factors (AARF), each scored 0.0-1.0:

| # | Factor | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Autonomy** | Agent acts without human approval |
| 2 | **Tool Use** | Agent has access to external tools or APIs |
| 3 | **Multi-Agent** | Agent interacts with or spawns other agents |
| 4 | **Non-Determinism** | Behavior varies unpredictably across runs |
| 5 | **Self-Modification** | Can alter own instructions or memory at runtime |
| 6 | **Dynamic Identity** | Assumes roles or identities at runtime |
| 7 | **Persistent Memory** | Retains state across sessions |
| 8 | **Natural Language Input** | Instruction surface via natural language |
| 9 | **Data Access** | Reads sensitive data (files, env vars, databases) |
| 10 | **External Dependencies** | Loads external code, skills, or remote content |

**Severity bands:**

| Band | AIVSS | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | >= 9.0 | Immediate exploitation, full agent compromise |
| HIGH | 7.0-8.9 | Significant data loss or privilege escalation |
| MEDIUM | 4.0-6.9 | Meaningful risk requiring review |
| LOW | < 4.0 | Limited impact or requires chaining |

**ThM (Threat Maturity) valid values:** `0.75` (theoretical) · `0.90` (PoC exists) · `1.0` (in-the-wild)

**Worked example — AVE-2026-00001 (Metamorphic Payload):**

```
AARF factors:
  autonomy=1.0  tool_use=1.0  multi_agent=0.5  non_determinism=1.0  self_modification=1.0
  dynamic_identity=0.0  persistent_memory=0.5  natural_language_input=1.0
  data_access=0.5  external_dependencies=1.0

AARS = 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 7.5
CVSS_Base = 8.5   ThM = 1.0 (in-the-wild)   Mitigation_Factor = 1

AIVSS = ((8.5 + 7.5) / 2) x 1.0 x 1 = 8.0  ->  HIGH
```

## Detect with Bawbel Scanner

Every AVE record has detection rules in
[bawbel/scanner](https://github.com/bawbel/scanner) — the reference
implementation of this standard.

```bash
pip install bawbel-scanner

# Scan a skill file
bawbel scan ./my-skill.md

# Scan a directory recursively
bawbel scan ./skills/ --recursive --fail-on-severity high

# Scan an MCP server card
bawbel scan-server-card https://api.your-mcp-server.io

# Full remediation report
bawbel report ./my-skill.md
```

Example output:

```
CRITICAL  bawbel-hook-hijack           AVE-2026-00046  line 3   AIVSS 9.2
HIGH      bawbel-unsafe-delegation     AVE-2026-00048  line 11  AIVSS 7.7
HIGH      bawbel-hardcoded-credential  AVE-2026-00047  line 5   AIVSS 7.6
```

Any tool can implement AVE — the records, schema, and rules are open.
See the [architecture guide](https://aveproject.org/architecture.html) and
the [implementer guide](docs/specs/ave-implementer-guide.md) for the
full consumption patterns including air-gapped environments.

## Implementing AVE in your scanner

Three patterns depending on your environment:

**Pattern 1 — Runtime API** (cloud CI/CD, always-on internet)
```python
import httpx
resp = httpx.get("https://api.aveproject.org/records/AVE-2026-00002")
record = resp.json()  # full record: fingerprint, IOCs, remediation, frameworks
```

**Pattern 2 — Bundled offline** (air-gapped, regulated environments)
```bash
# Always current, no release tag required -- regenerated on every records/ change
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aveproject/ave/main/dist/ave-records-latest.json \
  -o ave-records.json

# Or pin to a frozen, point-in-time snapshot instead of tracking current:
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aveproject/ave/main/dist/ave-records-v1.1.0.json \
  -o ave-records.json
```
A versioned snapshot is also attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/aveproject/ave/releases)
once one is cut; the raw paths above do not wait on that.

**Pattern 3 — ID-only emission** (SIEM resolves downstream, scanner makes no network calls)
```json
{ "rule_id": "your-rule", "ave_id": "AVE-2026-00002", "severity": "HIGH" }
```

The minimum viable integration is adding one field — `ave_id` — to your
existing finding output. See [docs/specs/ave-implementer-guide.md](docs/specs/ave-implementer-guide.md)
for the full guide including decision table, code examples, and how to
request a crosswalk for your scanner's rule IDs.

## Schema v1.1.0

Records validate against

`aivss.notes` · `evidence_kind_default` ·
`detection_stage` · `detection_layer` · `confidence_baseline` ·
`evidence_basis_engines` · `derivable_into`

`status: "draft"` records need only a reduced eight-field core (`ave_id`,
`schema_version`, `status`, `title`, `description`, `attack_class`,
`behavioral_fingerprint`, `references`) — the full 15-field required set
above applies once `status` is `active` or `deprecated`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the thin-submission path.

## Adding a new AVE record

### When to add a record

A new record needs all three: the attack class is not already covered by an
existing record, there is a citable primary source (CVE, paper, disclosed
incident, or working PoC), and the class is specific to agentic components —
not a generic web or API vulnerability.

If you think an existing class covers the behavior you found, open an issue
anyway. It may warrant a sub-case note in the parent record rather than a
new id.

### Step 1 — Open an issue

Open a **New AVE Record** issue before writing any JSON. Include:
- The proposed `attack_class` and one-sentence `behavioral_fingerprint`
- A link to the primary source
- Whether this is net-new or a variant of an existing record

The maintainer will confirm the next AVE id and whether it is a new class
or a variant update.

### Step 2 — Write the record

Copy [`records/AVE-2026-00001.json`](records/AVE-2026-00001.json) as a
template. All 15 required fields must be present and valid.

AIVSS calculation:
```
1. Score each AARF factor 0.0-1.0
2. AARS = sum of all 10 AARF scores
3. AIVSS = ((CVSS_Base + AARS) / 2) x ThM x Mitigation_Factor
4. ThM: 0.75 theoretical · 0.90 PoC exists · 1.0 in-the-wild
5. Round to 1 decimal
6. Severity: CRITICAL >= 9.0 · HIGH >= 7.0 · MEDIUM >= 4.0 · LOW < 4.0
```

Validate before opening a PR:
```bash
npm install ajv ajv-formats
node -e "
const Ajv = require('ajv/dist/2020');
const addFormats = require('ajv-formats');
const ajv = new Ajv({ strict: false });
addFormats(ajv);
const schema = require('./schema/ave-record-1.1.0.schema.json');
const record = require('./records/AVE-2026-NNNNN.json');
const ok = ajv.validate(schema, record);
if (!ok) console.error(ajv.errors); else console.log('valid');
"
```

### Step 3 — Add detection rules

Open a coordinated PR in [bawbel/scanner](https://github.com/bawbel/scanner)
with at least one detection rule and a positive and negative fixture.
The AVE record PR and the scanner PR should reference each other.

### Step 4 — PR format

Title: `feat: AVE-2026-NNNNN -- <attack class>`

The PR description must include:
- Link to the issue
- AARF scores with a one-line rationale for each non-zero factor
- At least one `indicators_of_compromise` entry a defender can actually search for
- Link to the primary source
- Link to the coordinated scanner PR

## Framework crosswalks

AVE records map to four external frameworks. Full crosswalk tables are
at [aveproject.org/crosswalks.html](https://aveproject.org/crosswalks.html).

| Framework | Field | Crosswalk |
|---|---|---|
| OWASP Agentic Security Initiative Top 10 | `owasp_asi` (ASI01-ASI10) | schema field, all applicable records |
| [OWASP Agentic Skills Top 10 (AST10)](https://owasp.org/www-project-agentic-skills-top-10/) | no dedicated schema field yet (`owasp_ast` planned) | [`crosswalks/ave-to-ast10.json`](crosswalks/ave-to-ast10.json) |
| OWASP MCP Top 10 | `owasp_mcp` | all records |
| MITRE ATLAS | `mitre_atlas` | where applicable |
| NIST AI RMF | `nist_ai_rmf` | where applicable |

| This scanner | Maps to AVE via |
|---|---|
| cfgaudit | [`crosswalks/cfgaudit-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/cfgaudit-to-ave.json) |
| ClawScan (OpenClaw) | [`crosswalks/clawscan-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/clawscan-to-ave.json) |
| nova-proximity (Nova-Hunting) | [`crosswalks/nova-proximity-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/nova-proximity-to-ave.json) |
| Ramparts (Highflame Inc.) | [`crosswalks/ramparts-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/ramparts-to-ave.json) |
| Semia (RiemaLabs) | [`crosswalks/semia-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/semia-to-ave.json) |
| SkillSpector (NVIDIA) | [`crosswalks/skillspector-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/skillspector-to-ave.json) |
| skill-security-scanner (honysyang) | [`crosswalks/skill-security-scanner-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/skill-security-scanner-to-ave.json) |
| skillsentry (vythanhtra) | [`crosswalks/skillsentry-to-ave.json`](crosswalks/skillsentry-to-ave.json) |

Maintaining a scanner? The [implementer guide](docs/specs/ave-implementer-guide.md)
covers how to map your rule IDs to AVE ids and add AVE ID emission to your
finding output. You can also open an issue and the maintainer will help with
the mapping.

## Governance and contributing

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the decision-making process, how records
are proposed and reviewed, and the path toward neutral governance.

See [docs/specs/scaling-and-governance.md](docs/specs/scaling-and-governance.md)
for record-growth discipline, schema versioning, and deprecation policy,
including AVE's ID stability guarantee: identifiers are never
renumbered or reused once published.

See [docs/specs/researcher-process.md](docs/specs/researcher-process.md)
for the practical, step-by-step process a contributor actually follows
when adding a new record, including a full worked example.

See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for what real external
contributors have actually built and caught, credited specifically,
not just listed by name.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributor-facing process.

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community standards.
